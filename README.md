# IrisFlowerPredictor
- Predicts Iris flower species using machine learning
This project is a simple yet powerful machine learning model that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its physical characteristics: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
Built using Python and scikit-learn, the model classifies flowers into one of three species:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica
